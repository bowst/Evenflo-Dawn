For fabric materials, we suggest wiping down your stroller’s seat fabric in cold water with a mild detergent. Be sure not to use solvents, caustic or abrasive cleaning materials (and never use chlorine bleach!). Keep Plastic\/Metal Parts in great shape by occasionally wiping them down using a mild soap and warm water. Keep your wheels fresh and fluid by cleaning them with a damp cloth. Dry them completely with a soft towel or cloth.<\/p>"
