This delay is only applicable for the first year that you signed up. <br\/> <br\/> All future birthday bonuses will be emailed to you on your birthday. If you register your birthday through your Rewards account any time after it has passed in the current calendar year, rewards will not be added to your account until the day of your birthday in the following year. <br\/> <br\/> Remember, the birthday reward is determined by the Rewards member tier that you are part of on the date of your birthday. If it has been more than 30 days since you registered for your birthday reward and you still have not received the additional points in your account, please reach out to our Parentlink Consumer Care team at Parentlink@evenflo.com.<\/p>"
